# Welcome to TrustO

Welcome to TrustO's GitHub page! We are a forward-thinking engineering consultancy, focused on building secure and private identity solutions that empower individuals and organizations. Our expertise lies in cutting-edge technologies like self-sovereign credentials, zero-knowledge proofs, and decentralized identity, particularly on the Cardano blockchain.

At TrustO, we believe in **redefining digital trust** for a more equitable and privacy-respecting future. We’re dedicated to creating infrastructure and tools that allow for **decentralized, user-centric identity management** — all while putting privacy, security, and user control at the forefront.

## About Us

Our work is driven by a belief in the power of **peer-to-peer** and **open-source solutions**. With a strong foundation in blockchain and decentralized technologies, we are building the next generation of identity management tools. By joining forces with the developer community, we create solutions that are scalable, adaptable, and usable across diverse industries, from finance to healthcare to Web3 platforms.

TrustO’s mission is to:
- **Identus-store** Secure and light weight storage engine for [Hyperledger Identus SDK](https://github.com/hyperledger-identus/sdk-ts), built on top of [RIDB](https://github.com/trust0-project/RIDB)
- **React** Provide easy to use integrations for React plarforms and Identus SDK. Abstracting all the complexity of using SSI and making it extremely simple to run end to end Issuance and Verification flows for (JWT, SDJWT, Anoncreds)

## Featured Projects

### RIDB
RIDB is a next-generation storage package tailored for Hyperledger Identus. Built with Rust for security and efficiency, it offers a dependency-free, secure storage wrapper designed to streamline identity-related storage.
